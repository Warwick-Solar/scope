Scope: Statistical Confidence of Oscillatory Processes with EMD
===============================================================

`scope` is the Python-based package for detecting oscillatory signals in observational or experimental time series with the EMD technique and assessing their statistical significance vs. power-law distributed background noise. 

Oscillatory processes in real datasets of various origins are often contaminated by a combination of white and coloured noise with a power-law spectral dependence, so that the EMD-revealed intrinsic mode functions need to be rigorously tested against the periodic components generated by noise. 

To do so, we compute the *EMD energy spectrum* containing the total energy and dominant period of each EMD-revealed intrinsic mode and the noise confidence limits for modal energy. This allows us to identify the significant mode(s) with the energy beyond the confidence limits, which is expected to be of a non-noise origin and associated with a quasi-periodic oscillatory process of interest. 

The developed package does not assume the physical origin of the input dataset, making it readily applicable for analysing oscillatory processes across various fields of science and industry.

Main Features
-------------

The project consists of the following main parts:

- **Perform EMD analysis** of the original time series and reveal the set of intrinsic modes using `Empirical Mode Decomposition in Python <https://emd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ (`Quinn et al. 2021 <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02977>`_).  
  See function :func:`scope.emd.emd_modes`.

- **Estimation of the power-law index and energy** of superimposed background noise from the Fourier power spectrum as described in `Vaughan (2005) <https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20041453>`_.  
  See function :func:`scope.fourier.fit_fourier`.

- **Estimation of the dominant period** of each EMD-revealed intrinsic mode from the global wavelet spectrum produced with `Torrence & Compo Wavelet Analysis Software <https://github.com/ct6502/wavelets>`_ (`Torrence & Compo 1998 <https://psl.noaa.gov/people/gilbert.p.compo/Torrence_compo1998.pdf>`_).  
  See function :func:`scope.emd.emd_period_energy`.

- **Calculate EMD confidence limits** using the method proposed by `Kolotkov et al. (2016) <https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201628306>`_.  
  See function :func:`emd_noise_conf`.

- **Visualise results** with :func:`plot_signal`, :func:`plot_modes`, :func:`plot_fft_spectrum`, and :func:`plot_emd_spectrum`.
